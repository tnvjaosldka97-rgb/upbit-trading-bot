"""
UMA Oracle Resolution Monitor.

When a market resolves, prices should converge to 0 or 1.
But the convergence is NOT instant — slow traders and inattentive bots
create a window of 2-10 minutes where you can buy YES at 0.85 in a
market that just resolved YES (and will settle at 1.00).

This is the cleanest, most reliable alpha on Polymarket.
Risk: Oracle dispute (N/A resolution). Handle with position sizing.
