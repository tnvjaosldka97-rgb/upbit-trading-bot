"""
Correlated Market Arbitrage — Highest Value Strategy.

Prediction markets contain logical constraints between related events.
When these constraints are violated, it's a genuine arbitrage (or near-arb).

Key insight: we model this as a DIRECTED graph with lead/lag relationships.
When the lead market moves, we have a time window T before the lag market
reprices. T can be measured empirically and is typically 1-10 minutes.

Relationship types:
  1. SUBSET: "Trump wins FL" ⊆ "Republican wins FL" → P(Trump) ≤ P(Rep)
  2. EXHAUSTIVE: "A wins" + "B wins" + "Other" should sum near 1.0
  3. IMPLICATION: "X wins primary" → "X is candidate in general" → price correlation
  4. CASCADE: Market A resolves → Market B must update price

This is the strategy that the Arxiv paper found extracted $40M from Polymarket.
Even capturing 0.001% of that is significant.
